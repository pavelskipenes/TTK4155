        The PWM is not continuously clocked. The programmer must first enable the PWM clock in the Power
        Management Controller (PMC) before using the PWM. However, if the application does not require PWM
        operations, the PWM clock can be stopped when not needed and be restarted later. In this case, the PWM will
        resume its operations where it left off.
        In the PWM description, Master Clock (MCK) is the clock of the peripheral bus to which the PWM is connected.

        * PWM Clock Generator p. 976

        The PWM master clock (MCK) is divided in the clock generator module to provide different clocks available for all
        channels. Each channel can independently select one of the divided clocks.

        Each linear divider can independently divide one of the clocks of the modulo n counter. The selection of the clock
        to be divided is made according to the PREA (PREB) field of the PWM Clock register (PWM_CLK). The resulting
        clock clkA (clkB) is the clock selected divided by DIVA (DIVB) field value.

        After a reset of the PWM controller, DIVA (DIVB) and PREA (PREB) are set to 0. This implies that after reset clkA
        (clkB) are turned off.

        Each channel selects and
        uses one of the clocks provided by the clock generator. The clock generator provides several clocks resulting from
        the division of the PWM master clock (MCK).
